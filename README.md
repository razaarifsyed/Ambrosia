# Ambrosia

This is a Java desktop application, actually created in 2017. I made this as a part of my software development lab project.
Used Netbeans IDE to develop this app in Java. Used MySQL for the database.

The purpose of the App is to control/Heakthify your diet. As the name of the app suggests, 'Ambrosia"- meaning food of the Greek gods. This app is meant only for those who eat in the Manipal University foodcourt, its based on their menu. 
The user firsts creates an account. Then we ask him for his current health information like height, weight, activity level etc. Then he set his target weight and target duration. Accordingly this app calculates and tells him how much calories he should be consuming everyday to reach his desired weight goal. 
Everyday he is suggested his calorie goal. The user enter into the system whatever he ate that day. And then the app shows the caloroies consumed. And if he consumes more/less than what was asked. Then accordingly his next days's calorie target is set. 




The app has many features like Signin/Signup Account Managing system, storing profile information, calculation calorie consumed, suggesting calories to consume, has the menu of the food court, feature to add any other calorie value manually if eaten from outside food. 

Notes

Please change my mysql password in the java net beans project source code. My MySQL password was "password" only, yours might be different. Find the connection statements in the java code and change the password accordingly. My MySQL username was 'root'.

After setting up the database, you can run the Java application directly by going to the folder, "dist" and then opening "Ambrosia.jar" file.

To set up the mysql database, open the "dbscoe.txt" file. Its the source code of the mysql database and code creation. 
Warning, i recreated this mysql source code later so might have errors. In that case, refer to the picture file "dbs.jpeg" and "dbs2.jpeg" of the orignial database. It has the screenshot of my table description and table contents respectively. Create a similar database-table and fill it before starting the app. 

It has only one table in the 'student' database with the name 'user'. 

Let me know if you need any help or liked my work :)
