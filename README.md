# Ambrosia

This is a Java desktop application, actually created in 2017. I made this as a part of my software development lab project.
Used Netbeans IDE to develop this app in Java. Used MySQL for the database.





The app has many features like Signin/Signup Account Managing system. User profiles(without different abstractions). Messaging service. Sending Friend Request, Friendlist, and of course the main feature - "Teach" or "Learn" a skill.

Notes

After setting up the database, you can run the Java application directly by going to the folder, "dist" and then opening "Ambrosia.jar" file.

To set up the mysql database, please refer to the picture file "dbs.jpeg" and "dbs2.jpeg". It has the screenshot of my table description and table contents respectively. Create a similar database-table and fill it before starting the app. 
It has only one table in the 'student'database with name 'user'. 

Let me know if you need any help or liked my work :)
